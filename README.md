MCSim
=====
#### An R package for metacommunity simulations and functions to calculate biodiversity metrics  
MCSim is a package for R that can be used to design lottery-based simulations of metacommunities, which can be used to test assumptions about how metacommunity dynamics influence emergent biodiversity patterns. See my paper in Ecological Modelling ([link](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380014004918)), which uses MCSim [v0.3](https://github.com/sokole/MCSim/releases/tag/v0.3). In the most recent release ([v0.4.2](https://github.com/sokole/MCSim/releases/tag/v0.4.2)), users can make use of igraph to design network topology and seed simulations with observed data. Please find the current version under development at https://github.com/sokole/MCSim.
