               J.t.minus.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{nu}{Numeric, Hubbell's "speciation rate", but can be interpreted as the 
probability of the appearance of a novel species.  If set to 0, no novel taxa 
will appear during the simulation.}

\item{SWM.slope}{Slope of dispersal kernel, see \link{fn.metaSIM}.  This value 
is used for \code{w} in eqn. 6 from Gravel et al. (2006) to model dispersal 
limitation.}

\item{J.t.minus.1}{Species composition of sites in a metacommunity at previous 
time step.}

\item{taxa.list}{A vector of character strings of species' names.}

\item{traits.Ef}{A vector of species' trait scores, numeric.}

\item{trait.Ef.sd}{A scalar value representing species' niche widths (numeric, 
currently one value is used for all species).}

\item{traits.dispersal}{A vector of species' dispersal trait scores.}

\item{landscape.site.coords}{A data.frame with xy-coordinates for each site.  Each row is a 
site in the metacommunity landscape.}

\item{landscape.m}{A vector of values for \code{m} for each site in the landscape.}

\item{landscape.Ef}{A vector of environmental filter \code{Ef} values for each site 
in the landscape.}

\item{landscape.Ef.specificity}{Environmental specificity at each site (numeric).}

\item{landscape.JL}{A vector of assemblage sizes (positive integers) for all sites 
in the landscape.}

\description{
Internal function called by \link{fn.metaSIM} to calculate local 
recruitment pools for all sites in a metacommunity, and call \link{fn.lottery.recruit}
to create a new assemblages (J) at time (t) after accounting for metacommunity 
composition at time (t-1), dispersal dynamics, landscape topology, and environmental 
filtering.
